== Negative Region With OpenCV

=== Introduction

In the old times, when the cameras were made from an analogic technology, it was common to see some films which had negatives images of a picture. In this negatives images, the dark points of a picture are turned bright, and the bright points are turned dark, as you can see in the <<negative_figure>> figure. This effect occour due chemical processes in the film. But today, with digital cameras, this effect isn't commonly seen. However, there are some cases where is intended to have a negative image, like in medicine applications.

This project will show a simple program that takes an image file and convert it in a negative image. Moreover, there will be the possibility of user choose the region that the program will apply the modification. For this, the user must give the image file name and two points. These points will define a rectangular region, and this region will be processed to have the negative effect.

=== Implemetation with OpenCV C++

We can work with two types of images: A grayscale and a colour image. In the case of grayscale image, to form a negative image, we need to apply the _not_ logical operation. Observing the binary representation, if you have a white pixel, its value is given by 255 (0b11111111). So, applying the _not_ operation, we will obtain the 0 (0b00000000) value response, representing a black pixel. In the same way, if you apply the operation _not_ in a black pixel, it will be white. This rule can be applied for any value in a pixel, and in case of colour image, the same rule is valid for each _R_, _G_ and _B_ pixel: apply the _not_ operation, and you will take a negative value of each layer.

The next C++ code show one way to have a negative from a colour image:

[[negative_image_code, negative_image.cpp]]
.negative_image.cpp
[source,cpp,options="nowrap"]

include::codes/negative_image.cpp[]

==== How the code works?

To obtain the wished behavior, the next steps are made:
